Datastash
=========

A tool to detect when things happen.

Datastash lets you give it a list of instructions which it runs periodically. For example, this could be scraping a list of names from a website and comparing them against another list of people you are interested in. Each time it runs it compares the results to the previous time. If there are any new records you recieve an email.
